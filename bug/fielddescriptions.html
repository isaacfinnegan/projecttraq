<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>NEW</b> - This bug has
recently been added to the assignee's list of bugs and must be processed.
Bugs in this state may be accepted, and become ASSIGNED, passed on to someone
else or remain with original Assigned To.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>ASSIGNED</b> - This bug is not
yet resolved, but is assigned to the proper person.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>REOPENED</b> - This bug was once
resolved, but the resolution was deemed incorrect. For example, a WORKS
AS DESIGNED bug is REOPENED when more information shows up and the bug
is now reproducible.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>RESOLVED</b> - A resolution has
been taken, and it is awaiting verification by SQE. From here bugs are
either re-opened and become REOPENED, are marked VERIFIED, or are closed
for good and marked CLOSED.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>VERIFIED</b> - SQE has looked
at the bug and the resolution and agrees that the appropriate resolution
has been taken. Bugs remain in this state until the product they were reported
against actually ships, at which point they become CLOSED.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>CLOSED</b> - The bug is considered
closed out since project is complete.&nbsp; This field is often used when
doing one final pass of testing on the final candidate of the&nbsp; project.</font></blockquote>

<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The resolution field indicates what
happened to this bug as it was set to RESOLVED Status. Any of the following
may apply:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>FIXED - </b>A fix for
this bug is checked into the code tree and tested by engineer as working.</font>

described is not a bug .</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>WILL NOT FIX</b> - The problem
described is a bug which will never be fixed.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>DEFERRED</b> - The problem described
is a bug which will not be fixed in this phase/version of the product.
But may be fixed in a later version.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>DUPLICATE</b> - The problem is
a duplicate of an existing bug. Marking a bug duplicate requires the bug#
of the duplicating bug to at least be noted&nbsp; in the description field.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>UNABLE TO REPRODUCE</b> - All
attempts at reproducing this bug were futile, reading the code produces
no clues as to why this behavior would occur. If more information appears
later, please re-assign the bug, for now, file it.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>MOVED</b> - Bug was moved to a
Task record, another project, or another database system.</font></blockquote>
