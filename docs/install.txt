Quick Installation Instructions:

(for upgrading, see docs/upgrade.txt)

1.	Install Software Prerequisites:

	You will need the following software installed to get the ProjectTraq system up and running.

	mysql >= 3.23.x

	apache
	Optionally: mod_perl with apache.  ProjectTraq runs much faster in a mod_perl environment

	The following perl modules are required.
	these can be installed by typing
	
		perl -MCPAN -e 'install MODULENAME'
		
For Windows, you may use the ActiveState Perl distribution's PPM (perl package manager)
Just type the following from within ppm
		
		install MODULENAME  
		
		(NOTE: For modules in PPM, use - instead of ::  i.e.   Mail::Sendmail -> Mail-Sendmail)
    
 # You will need to install a mysql DBD driver for perl		
	DBI  (and optionally  Apache::DBI if using mod_perl)
  DBD::mysql
 # This is not the only mysql DBI driver that can be used
 # You will need to install a mysql DBD driver for perl		
	CGI
	Mail::Sendmail
	MIME::Base64
	Date::Calc
	Crypt::CBC
	Crypt::Blowfish
		(NOTE: On windows ActiveState is not allowed to distribute this module.  You may wish to add the theoryx PPM repository.
		You can do this by typing (for ActiveState Perl 5.8.4):
		rep add "TheoryX" http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/
		from within ppm)
	Storable  (comes in perl 5.8)
	
	Optional:
	Sys::Syslog
	Net::LDAP	
	GD


2.	Untar-zip the .tgz file somewhere in your web tree (ideally where it is going to end up).

3.	Database - 
	
	Run the following commands:
	
	mysql -e "create database projecttraq"
	mysql -e "grant all privileges on projecttraq.* to projecttraq@localhost identified by 'password'"
	mysql -e "flush privileges"
	mysql -uprojecttraq -ppassword projecttraq < createdb.sql
	
	The script createdb.sql will create all the necessary tables/records needed by piss to function.   

	NOTE:  A default administrator account is created (user: admin pass: changeme)  YOU MUST CHANGE THIS!  When you finish setting up the system log in as admin and change the password.
	
4.	Setup configuration
	Copy the lib/traq.cfg.dist file to /etc/traq.cfg or /usr/local/etc/traq.cfg if you move this file to another location, you must edit the <projecttraq root>/lib/TraqConfig.pm file so that it can find the traq.cfg file.   Then edit file according to your needs.  This file is fairly well commented, so you should just read through it and make the appropriate changes.
	Be sure to read through all configuration options, as many settings will be needed before continuing (such as path info.) 

5.	Apache changes
	The following configuration changes will need to be made to apache to allow projecttraq to run.  You may add or change these lines in your httpd.conf

    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
	
	DirectoryIndex index.html index.cgi
	
	<Directory -path to installation->
    Options +ExecCGI
    </Directory>


6.	Test setup
	You may use the testSetup.pl script to verify everything is setup correctly for the Perl environment.
	Then hit 

7.	Optional mod_perl setup
	mod_perl allows perl programs to run much faster in apache by staying compiled.   You can setup projecttraq for mod_perl by doing the following:
	
	-use the startup.pl.dist script provided in the lib/ directory. You will need to modify following line to match your installation path.
	
			use lib qw(/www/htdocs/projecttraq/lib);
 
 
	-Add the following to your apache config (modify path's as apropriate)
	mod_perl:
	
	###   ProjectTraq mod_perl
	PerlRequire /www/conf/startup.pl
	PerlModule Apache::Registry
	<Directory /www/htdocs/projecttraq>
		<Files *.cgi>
    	    SetHandler perl-script
        	PerlHandler Apache::Registry
		  	PerlSendHeader On
		</Files>
	</Directory>
	
	
	for mod_perl2, add the following to you <apache root>/conf.d/perl.conf (modify path's as apropriate):
	
	
	###   ProjectTraq mod_perl2
	PerlModule Apache2::compat
	<Directory /www/htdocs/projecttraq>
		<Files *.cgi>
		        SetHandler perl-script
		        PerlHandler ModPerl::Registry
		        PerlOptions +ParseHeaders
		</Files>
	</Directory>
	PerlRequire /www/conf/startup.pl
