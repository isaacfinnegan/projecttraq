projecttraq was designed (at least from 2.0 on) to be very easy to customize.  The easiest thing to customize is adding fields.  To add a field to the system, you only need to do the following steps (at a minimum)

1.  Add the field to the database (allow null, and this can be done live and anytime)

2. Add the field and it's label to the label hashes in the config file for the relevant area (task/bug)

3. Add the form field to the html template file.  

All done!

Now, if you want to make the field a select field, or use dynamic menus, or have other special work flow functionality, read on...


#TODO  - complete this
