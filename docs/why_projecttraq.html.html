<span class="style2">Why ProjectTraq?<br> <hr>
</span><span class="style3">In June of 2004, the Good Engineering department began to plan for upcoming growth in support of:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="style3">Increased concurrent multi-project development</span></li>
  <li class="style3">Increased device/carrier support</li>
  <li class="style3">Standardized, efficient project communication between all planning, development and support product teams. <br>
  (Product Management, Developmental Engineers, Build Release, QA, Technical Publications, Customer Support, Escalations)</li>
  <li class="style3">Maintaining quick response for increased customer support </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="style3">The primary functional requirements outlined after multiple interviews with various Good product teams for an improved bug tracking tool included:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li class="style3">Ability for individual product line owners to customize their field menus and required fields. </li>
  <li class="style3">Ability to track work tasks/project planning separately from bugs, but within a global project query. </li>
  <li class="style3">Ability to track escalation issues within one record with the bug information. </li>
  <li class="style3">Canned reports for bug daily/trend metrics as well as assignment/work distribution</li>
  <li class="style3">Ability to estimate time/schedule for new development/bug fixes </li>
  <li class="style3">Ability to track sales/customer Feature Requests separately from bug entries for future project PRD inclusion. </li>
  <li class="style3">Separate tracking for Customer Support and Escalations bugs/issues </li>
</ul>
<p class="style3">ProjectTraq was selected as the tool to address all current and future needs. Customization of this open source database to meet Good Technology needs began in July 2004 with total migration from Bugzilla estimated to be completed in December 2004. </p>
