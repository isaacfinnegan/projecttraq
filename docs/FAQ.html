<p class="style1"><span class="style2">ProjectTraq FAQ</span><br>
  <span class="style6">Below are the answers to the most frequently asked questions regarding the ProjectTraq tool.<br>
  For additional questions, please contact <a href="mailto:projecttraq@good.com">projecttraq@good.com</a> </span></p>
<hr>
<p class="style1"><em><strong>What is the Save And Force Notification button?</strong></em><br>
  <span class="style12">The
Save and Force Notification feature overrides individual user Email Settings preferences. For example: User has set up their personal Email Settings to not be emailed when an Attachment is being added to record. BUT you wanted to ensure everyone on the record gets the info regarding the critical attachment being added regardless of their email settings. You can Save and Force Notification - this overrides their email preferences. </span></p>
<p class="style4"><span class="style11">The list of people in the CC field is very long and cumbersome to use. <br>
  Will it be more user friendly?</span><br>
  Yes. There are currently development plans on the schedule to address this by April 2005. Re-design planning under way.</p>
<p class="style4"><em><strong><span class="style9">Searching on multiple product is the query page shows duplicate Target Milestone values.<br>
Why does this occur and how do I search properly?</span><br>
</strong></em>This occurs because every product line has its own distinctive set of Target Milestones. When product use the same Target Milestone nomenclature, ProjectTraq is not currently set up to recognize that TMs are the same, and group into one value. This will be resolved with the Feb 28, 2005 release of ProjectTraq updates. </p>
<p class="style4">To search for multiple products with the same milestone, user will need to select all TMs with same nomenclature in the Target Milestone field for the query. Example: If you wanted to to query for Products = Goodlink Client, Goodlink Server with TM Skyy_RTM, you will need to select the two Skyy_RTM values in the Target Milestone field. One is for Goodlink Client, one is for Goodlink Server. </p>
<p class="style4"><span class="style9"><em><strong>What is the Whiteboard/URL field in the the Details TAB?</strong></em></span><br>
  The Whiteboard/URL field is similar to a whiteboard. A user can enter any text they want in this field and query for it. The GoodAccess Client Dev/QA teams use this field to enter URL where bug occurs. They can then query or view a list of bugs found with similar URLs. Additional Example: A triage is underway to determine where we stand with final RTM bugs to complete project. The triage team may opt to put &quot;Fix in Hand&quot;, &quot;Investigating&quot; OR &quot;Need QA retest&quot; in the Whiteboard/URL field. The triage team can then easily see in a bug list where the final bugs stand in the drive to zarro bugs/ship.</p>
<p class="style4"><span class="style11">How do I query for my open assigned bugs AND tasks (basically all of my items in one query)?</span><br>
  - Select either Bug Search Page or Task Search Page under &quot;Query&quot; menu on the navigation bar <br>
  - Select both Bug and Task checkboxes from the the &quot;Get All&quot; at top of search page.<br>
  - Select your name in the &quot;User&quot; field mid-way down the search page <br>
- If on the Bug Search Page, go to Status field at bottom left of search page, and select all but Verified or Closed.<br>
- If on the Task Search Page, go to Status field at bottom left of search page, and select all but Completed..<br>
  - Click on &quot;Submit query&quot; at top right of the search page<br>
- All bugs and tasks assigned to you will display in a list view. </p>
<p class="style4"><span class="style11">How do I print the a bug record so that description field displays fully?</span><br>
  There are three Size settings for the Description field in a bug - Normal, Large and Unlimited. Select Unlimited for the but you wish to print. Print record in Landscape mode to print full record.</p>
<p class="style4"><span class="style11">Why am I prompted to comment for  my field changes? </span><br>
  Though there is an Activity Log that documents all changes/updates executed on a record, it is important to comment as to WHY you are making the change. ProjectTraq prompts the user to comment in order to encourage these comments. <br>
  <br>
  NOTE: The ProjectTraq Development Team has received a lot of feedback on this feature. Users do not feel that every field change should require a comment. Thus, this feature is being re-evaluated per this feedback and some fields changes will no longer require comments in the near future. A change to the cc field is one of the fields which will no longer require a comment. </p>
